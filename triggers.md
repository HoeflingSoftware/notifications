## TRIGGERS

Triggers are a fantastic away of firing a notification from an event.  Triggers also offer a way of repeating instead of a one off "fire and forget".
This library supports 3 kinds of triggers:

* [Calendar](calendar.md) - Calendar events are a way of scheduling an event at some time in the future
    * Yearly on January 30 at 7am (HAPPY BIRTHDAY)
    * Monthly 1st day of the month at 12am (PINCH AND PUNCH, FIRST OF THE MONTH!)
    * Every Monday at 9pm (sprint planning...yay)
    * Sunday Oct 28, 2018 @ 12pm (NFL FOOTBALL)

* [Time Intervals](intervals.md) - Intervals are a good way to constantly checkin and don't necessarily have a set time
    * Every 4 hours - check blood pressure from people not reading these docs!
    * Tell me again in 2 hours that I'm procrastinating

* [Geofencing](geofencing.md) - Geofences are a fantastic way of getting your userbase attention based on entering and/or exiting a location
    * Entry - We noticed you were near our awesome store - we have some epic prices right now
    * Exit - Sorry to see you leave.  Hopefully you bought lots of our junk!
